# Property Investment Analysis Tool (v1.5.1)

## Overview

This web application provides a flexible financial analysis tool for property investments. It allows users to define and compare multiple investment scenarios across different locations (initially Barcelona, Spain, and Copenhagen, Denmark) and property types.

The tool calculates purchase costs, running costs, selling costs, and potential financial outcomes under various appreciation scenarios (average, low-risk, high-risk, zero growth) over a specified holding period, incorporating loan interest costs for a more accurate win/loss assessment.

## Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Python (Flask)
-   **Frontend:** TypeScript (React)
-   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
-   **UI Components:** Tailwind CSS (basic implementation)

## Architecture

The project follows a monorepo structure:

-   `/backend`: Contains the Flask application handling API requests and calculations.
-   `/frontend`: Contains the React application providing the user interface.
-   `docker-compose.yml`: Defines and orchestrates the backend and frontend services for local development.
-   `Dockerfile` (in backend/ and frontend/): Define the container images.

## Features (v1.4)

-   **Multi-Scenario Comparison:** Define and compare multiple investment scenarios side-by-side.
-   **Flexible Inputs:**
    -   **Global Settings:** Years to Sell, Display Currency, Personal Finance (optional).
    -   **Per Scenario:** Country (Spain/Denmark), City (Barcelona/Copenhagen), Property Type, Price, Loan Details, Renovations, Payment Schedules (for under construction), Country-Specific options (Beckham Law, Andelsl√•n).
-   **Property Types:**
    -   Spain: New Build, Second Hand, Under Construction
    -   Denmark: Ejerlejlighed, Andelslejlighed, New Build, Under Construction
-   **Cost Calculation:** Purchase (taxes, fees, VAT/ITP), Running (property taxes, community fees), Selling (agency fees, capital gains), Loan Interest (total paid over holding period).
-   **Scenario Analysis:** Average, Low Risk, High Risk, Zero Growth appreciation outcomes calculated for each defined scenario.
-   **User Interface:** Tabbed interface for managing multiple scenarios, grouped input sections, basic results display showing key metrics per scenario.
-   **Educational Tests:** Backend unit tests (`pytest`) with explanations of financial concepts.

## Setup and Running (Local Development)

**Prerequisites:**

-   Docker
-   Docker Compose

**Steps:**

1.  **Extract the archive (`property_analyzer_v1.5.1.tar.gz`).**
2.  **Navigate to the project root directory (`property_analyzer`).**
3.  **Build and start the services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    *Note: The initial build might take a few minutes, especially for the frontend dependencies.*
4.  **Access the application:**
    -   Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
    -   Backend API: `http://localhost:5000`

## Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables for flexible deployment:

-   **API URL Configuration:** The frontend uses the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable to connect to the backend API.
    -   In `docker-compose.yml`, this is set to `http://localhost:5000/api` by default.
    -   For different deployment environments, modify this value in `docker-compose.yml` or provide it at runtime.
    -   If not specified, the application falls back to a development proxy configuration in `vite.config.ts`.

**Example configurations:**

```yaml
# For local development with Docker
VITE_API_URL: "http://localhost:5000/api"

# For production deployment with a different domain
VITE_API_URL: "https://api.example.com/api"

# For internal Docker network communication
VITE_API_URL: "http://backend:5000/api"
```

## Development Notes

-   **Backend:**
    -   Activate virtual environment: `source backend/venv/bin/activate`
    -   Install dependencies: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
    -   Run tests: `pytest` (within venv)
    -   Run development server: `flask run --host=0.0.0.0` (within venv)
-   **Frontend:**
    -   Navigate to `frontend/`
    -   Install dependencies: `npm install`
    -   Run development server: `npm run dev`

## Current Status & Limitations (as of v1.4)

-   Core backend and frontend logic for multi-scenario comparison is implemented and functional.
-   UI provides basic input fields, tabs, and results display (key metrics + raw JSON).
-   **Pending/Future Enhancements:**
    -   **Advanced Frontend:** UI refinement (e.g., using shadcn/ui components, high-contrast options), sophisticated results visualization (e.g., charts, formatted breakdown tables instead of raw JSON - CR1.4).
    -   **Backend Assumptions:** Calculations still rely on some proxy values (e.g., cadastral value for IBI) and simplified logic for complex taxes (Plusvalia, detailed capital gains rules). These are noted as warnings.
    -   **Bonus Tools:** Loan Repayment Schedule and Rental Yield Calculator are not implemented.




## Key Features (v1.5)

Includes all features from v1.4, plus:

-   **Renting Scenario Analysis (Baseline Comparison):**
    -   **Inputs:** Users can optionally define a renting scenario by providing:
        -   Monthly Rent
        -   Monthly Water Cost
        -   Monthly Utilities Cost
        -   Monthly Parking Cost
        -   Annual percentage increment for each of the above costs.
    -   **Calculation:** The tool calculates the total cost of renting over the specified `Years to Sell`, accounting for the annual increments for each cost component.
    -   **Results Display:**
        -   The "Total Renting Cost" is displayed as a "Base Index" for comparison.
        -   The purchase scenario results table is augmented with an "Index Adjusted Profit / (Loss)" column. This column shows the purchase scenario's raw profit/loss minus the total renting cost, providing a direct comparison against the renting baseline.
        -   The results table row order is now: Zero Growth, Average Growth, Low Risk, High Risk.
